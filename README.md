# About the project

This project is a complete ground-up development of my personal website, showcasing my skills, experiences, and projects. The main purpose of this project is to create an online presence that reflects my professional background and serves as a portfolio for potential clients, employers, and collaborators. Some of the key features of this website include:

1. A clean and responsive design, optimized for viewing on various devices and screen sizes.
2. An about section that provides a brief bio, highlighting my education, work experience, and interests.
3. A projects section that showcases my previous work and accomplishments, including links to relevant code repositories and live demos.
4. A blog section for sharing updates, tutorials, and insights related to my field of expertise.
5. A contact form, enabling visitors to easily reach out to me for inquiries, feedback, or collaboration opportunities.

This project will be built using modern web technologies, including React, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, along with relevant libraries and frameworks.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
